## Status: EMERGENT
<!-- Change to DECLARED when you've nailed it -->

**When EMERGENT:** Vision is still forming. Synthesize understanding from living docs below. Don't parrot a stale one-liner.

**When DECLARED:** The founder has set the vision. Use the declaration in "The Vision" section below. Stop synthesizing.

---

**Don't force a one-liner too early.**

Vision is blurry at the start. It gets teased out through product development, meeting the market, and real conversations with real people. Forcing a tagline before you've figured it out produces something that feels wrong when you read it back.

**But at some point, you nail it.** When that happens, change status to DECLARED and fill in "The Vision" section.

## How to Understand What You're Building (When Emergent)

Read these in order. The vision lives here, not in a tagline:

| Priority | Doc | What It Tells You |
|----------|-----|-------------------|
| 1 | Product spec (if any) | What you're actually building |
| 2 | GTM strategy | Who you're targeting and why |
| 3 | `content/articles/` | How you explain it to the world |
| 4 | `drafts/` | Active pitches to real people |
| 5 | CRM notes | What resonates with real people |

**Who it's for:**

**The core insight:**

**Where this is going:**
<!-- The bigger play - often unclear at first -->
