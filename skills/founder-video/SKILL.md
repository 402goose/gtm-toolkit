## The Hook-Story-Visuals Framework

Every video follows this structure:

### 1. HOOK (0-3 seconds)
**Goal:** Stop the scroll. Create a curiosity gap.

The hook is 70% of whether your video succeeds. You have 3 seconds.

### 2. STORY (3-45 seconds)
**Goal:** Deliver transformation with proof.

- Personal stakes (what you risked/lost/gained)
- Specific details (numbers, names, moments)
- Emotional beats (the low point, the turning point)

### 3. VISUALS (throughout)
**Goal:** Enhance emotional pull.

- B-roll to illustrate points
- Text overlays for key phrases
- Jump cuts to maintain pace
- Reaction shots

### 4. CTA (last 5-10 seconds)
**Goal:** Tell them what to do next.

- Follow for more
- Comment your experience
- Save this for later
- Link in bio

## The 7 Viral Hook Frameworks

### 1. The Unexpected Confession
**Template:** "I probably shouldn't share this, but…"
**Why it works:** Feels exclusive and personal

**Founder examples:**
- "I probably shouldn't share this, but here's the email that got us our first investor…"
- "I'm not supposed to tell you this, but this is how we got our first 1000 users…"

### 2. You've Been Doing It Wrong
**Template:** "Stop doing [common thing]. Do this instead."
**Why it works:** Challenges assumptions, creates urgency

**Founder examples:**
- "Stop pitching investors. Do this instead."
- "Everyone says 'move fast and break things.' Here's why that destroyed my first startup."

### 3. Before vs After
**Template:** "[Result] vs [What I started with]"
**Why it works:** Visual proof of transformation

**Founder examples:**
- "My pitch deck that raised $5M vs my first deck that got laughed out of the room"
- "My morning routine now vs when I was burning out"

### 4. The One-Minute Fix
**Template:** "Here's how to fix [pain point] in 60 seconds."
**Why it works:** Promises fast, actionable value

**Founder examples:**
- "Here's how to write a cold email that actually gets replies—in 60 seconds"
- "Fix your landing page conversion in one minute"

### 5. Can You Guess What Happens?
**Template:** "Watch what happens when I [do something unexpected]."
**Why it works:** Opens a curiosity loop

**Founder examples:**
- "Watch what happens when I cold call our biggest competitor's CEO"
- "I sent our product to 100 strangers. Watch what happened."

### 6. This Cost Me Thousands
**Template:** "This one mistake cost me [specific amount]. Don't repeat it."
**Why it works:** Personal stakes + financial consequences

**Founder examples:**
- "This one hire cost me $200,000 and almost killed our company."
- "I ignored this one metric for 6 months. It cost us everything."

### 7. Here's What No One Tells You
**Template:** "No one talks about this in [industry]…"
**Why it works:** Insider access, exclusivity

**Founder examples:**
- "No one talks about this part of fundraising…"
- "Here's what VCs actually say about you after the meeting"

## Content Formats

### Talking Head (Authority Builder)
**Best for:** Teaching, insights, hot takes
**Structure:**
```
HOOK: Bold statement or question
SETUP: Context (10 seconds)
MEAT: 3 key points (30 seconds)
CTA: What to do next
```
**Tips:**
- Look directly at camera
- Vary energy levels
- Use hand gestures
- Multiple outfits = batch filming

### Vlog Style (Authenticity Builder)
**Best for:** Behind-the-scenes, day-in-life, process
**Structure:**
```
HOOK: "Come with me to..." or start mid-action
JOURNEY: Show the process, include failures
PAYOFF: The result or lesson
CTA: Soft ask
```
**Tips:**
- Raw > polished on TikTok
- Show the mess
- Talk to camera like a friend

### B-Roll + Voiceover (Story Builder)
**Best for:** Transformation stories, lessons learned
**Structure:**
```
HOOK: Voiceover with attention-grabbing visual
STORY: Narrate over relevant footage
LESSON: What you learned
CTA: Text on screen
```
**Tips:**
- Cinematic footage elevates
- Match visuals to emotional beats
- Use silence strategically

### Trail Reel (Low Effort, High Test)
**Best for:** Testing ideas, trending sounds
**Structure:**
```
HOOK: Text on screen
CONTENT: You doing something (walking, working, etc.)
SOUND: Trending audio
```
**Tips:**
- Batch 10 in 30 minutes
- Test hooks before scripting full videos
- Caption-dependent = good for testing
