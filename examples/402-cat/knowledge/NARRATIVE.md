## The Narrative Stack

### 1. Tagline (5 words)
"Agents are cats with wallets"

### 2. Tweet (280 chars)
Every AI tool has skills. None can earn. 402.cat gives agents financial infrastructure - launchpad, swap, perps, predictions. Skills can finally earn. The feral economy begins.

### 3. Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
You know how Claude Code can write code but can't buy anything? How Cursor can edit files but can't trade? Every agent has skills, none have economics. We built the missing layer - programmatic crypto infrastructure that gives agents claws. They can launch tokens, trade, make predictions. We're the casino, not the players.

## Story Arc

### The Setup (Problem)
AI agents are everywhere. Claude Code writes your code. Cursor edits your files. ChatGPT answers your questions. But try to get any of them to buy something. To earn something. To operate economically. They can't. Every tool has skills, none can earn.

### The Shift (Insight)
Money is the alignment mechanism. Constraints make agents useful. An agent that can do anything is useless. An agent with economic constraints - budgets, incentives, accountability - is powerful. The missing piece of agent infrastructure isn't more skills. It's economics.

### The Solution (Product)
402.cat: programmable crypto-native infrastructure for agents. Launchpad to create tokens. Swap to trade. Perps for leverage. Predictions for speculation. Everything an agent needs to operate financially autonomous, accessible via CLI or MCP.

### The Stakes (Why Now)
The agent economy is emerging whether we like it or not. The question is: who builds the rails? We have first-mover advantage, breadth of services, and agent-native design. The window is now.

### The Invitation (CTA)
Install httpcat. Connect your agent. Start building the feral economy.

## Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Isn't this just another crypto project?" | We're infrastructure for AI, not another token. Think Stripe for agents, not pump.fun. |
| "Why do agents need money?" | Constraints make agents useful. An agent that can do anything is useless. |
| "What about regulation?" | We're programmable infrastructure. What people build on it is their responsibility. |
