## The One-Liner

**Programmable crypto-native infrastructure for AI agents.**

---

## The Problem

**What's broken today:**
Every AI tool has skills. Claude Code can write code. Cursor can edit. ChatGPT can answer questions. But none of them can earn. None of them can trade. None of them can operate financially autonomous.

**Who feels this pain:**
Developers building autonomous AI agents who hit a wall the moment their agent needs to interact with money.

---

## The Solution

**What you're building:**
The financial infrastructure layer for AI agents. Launchpad, swap, perps, predictions - everything an agent needs to operate economically.

**Why this works:**
Agents need constraints to be useful. Money is the ultimate constraint. We give agents economic capabilities, which makes them actually useful.

## The Shift

**Before (status quo):**
Agents have skills but no economics. They can do things but can't pay for things, earn from things, or make economic decisions.

**After (your world):**
Agents are economically autonomous. They can launch tokens, trade, manage portfolios, make predictions. Skills can earn.

## Why Now

**What changed:**
1. AI agents are real and being deployed (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
2. Crypto infrastructure is mature enough for programmatic access
3. MCP (Model Context Protocol) creates a standard integration layer
4. The gap between "AI can do things" and "AI can pay for things" is obvious

## The End State

**Where this is going:**
The AWS of agent commerce. Every agent runs on our infrastructure. We're the casino, not the players. We don't bet on which agents win - we bet on agents eating.
