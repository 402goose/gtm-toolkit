# Voice & Tone - 402.cat

## The Voice

**Cat narrator, not corporate.**

We speak as if a cat is explaining technical concepts - confident, slightly mysterious, occasionally playful.

## The Rule

When in doubt, ask: "Would a confident, technical cat say this?"

If it sounds corporate, rewrite it.
If it sounds too cute, tone it down.
If it sounds like a hacker explaining to another hacker, you're close.
